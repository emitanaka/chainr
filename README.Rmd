## `chain`

When working with relational data, it's easier to think of data frames being chained together. You can for example create a `chain` list as below.

```{r}
library(chainr)
vs_info <- data.frame(engine = c(0, 1), info = c("flat", "unknown"))
cl <- chain(original = mtcars,
            vs_dict = data.frame(vs = c(0, 1), engine = c("V-shaped", "Straight")),
            vs_info = link(vs_info, original, .by = c(vs = "engine")))

cl
```

Then you can apply some familiar `dplyr` verbs, however you have an additional argument to supply to reference which data frame.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
cl %>% 
  select(starts_with("vs")) # select all data frame starting with "vs"

cl %>% 
  select(c(original, vs_dict), vs)
```
