## `chain`

When working with relational data, it's easier to think of data frames being chained together. You can for example create a `chain` list as below.

```{r}
library(chainr)
usa <- chain(
      state_stats = as.data.frame(state.x77),
      state_info = data.frame(name = state.name,
                              abb = state.abb,
                              division = state.division,
                              region = state.region),
      arrests = USArrests
    )
```

Then you can apply some familiar `dplyr` verbs, however you have an additional argument to supply to reference which dataset(s). 

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
usa %>% 
  select(arrests, Murder) %>% 
  str()
```

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
usa %>% 
  select_links(starts_with("state")) %>% 
  str()
```


## SQL database

Thinking about it, this is the same concept as setting up a SQL database.
